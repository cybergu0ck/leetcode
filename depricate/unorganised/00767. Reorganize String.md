# Brute Force

- The logic used in this Brute Force approach is good, however the datastructure's aren't.

  ```py
  class Solution:
      def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
          length = len(s)
          count = dict(Counter(s))
          if (len(list(count.keys())) == 1 and len(s) != 1):
              return ""
          count = dict(sorted(count.items(), key = lambda x:x[1], reverse = True))
          res = list(count.keys())[0]
          count[res] -= 1



          while (len(res) != length):
              count = dict(sorted(count.items(), key = lambda x:x[1], reverse = True))
              large = list(count.keys())[0]

              if (large == res[-1]):
                  if (list(count.values())[1] == 0):
                      return ""
                  else:
                      large = list(count.keys())[1]
                      res += large
                      count[large] -=1
              else:
                  res += large
                  count[large] -= 1

          return res
  ```

# Efficient, O(n\*logn)

- Using heaps!

  ```py
  class Solution:
      def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
          count = Counter(s)
          max_heap = [[-freq, char] for char, freq in count.items()]
          heapq.heapify(max_heap) #O(n)
          res = ''
          prev = None

          while max_heap or prev:
              if (prev and not max_heap):
                  return ""
              freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
              res += char
              freq += 1   #We increment this because we are using min_heap as max_heap

              if prev:
                  heapq.heappush(max_heap, prev)
                  prev = None

              if freq != 0:
                  prev = [freq, char] #No need of -freq because it is already calculated above
          return res
  ```
