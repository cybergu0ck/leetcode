## Clarifications

- Can the input array contains duplicates?

  - Yes

- Can the input array contain negative numbers?

  - It is mentioned that the input array is an integer array, hence the array can contains negative values.

- Given the objective, it means that the input array contains a minimum of 3 elements right?

  - Yes

- Is it true that a solution exists for every input?

  - No, there might be no solution, in such case return empty array.

| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Has solution | [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4] | [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]] |
| No solution  | [0,1,1]          | []                   |

## Solution

<br>
<br>

### Brute force

<br>

#### Explanation

Check every possible combination of three elements using nested iterations.

<br>

#### Complexity analysis

- Time Complexity : This is a cubic, $O(n^3)$ solution in terms of time, where $n$ is size of the input array.
- Space Complexity : This is a constant, $O(1)$ solution in terms of space. Not considering the array storing the results.

### Quadratic solution

```py
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        nums.sort() #nlogn

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if(i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]):
                continue
            l = i + 1
            r = len(nums) - 1

            while(l<r):
                sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if(sum < 0):
                    l += 1
                elif(sum > 0):
                    r -= 1
                else:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                    while(l < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1]):
                        l+= 1
                    while(l < r and nums[r] == nums[r+1]):
                        r -= 1
        return res
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> res;
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for(int i=0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
            if(i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1])
                continue;
            int l = i + 1;
            int r = nums.size() - 1;

            while(l < r){
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r];
                if(sum < 0)
                    l += 1;
                else if(sum >0)
                    r -= 1;
                else{
                    res.push_back({nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]});
                    l += 1;
                    r -= 1;
                    while(l<r && nums[l] == nums[l-1])
                        l += 1;
                    while(l<r && nums[r] == nums[r+1])
                        r -= 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### Explanation

Sort the array, then iterate with one pointer, using two additional pointers from opposite ends of the remaining elements to find triplets summing to zero, updating pointers and recording results.

- Sort the array, this will enable the use of "two pointer approach".
- Iterate over the array, the index will be used as the first pointer.
  - It must be ensured that the updated index does not point to same value again. Note the check `if(i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1])`. This is done to avoid duplicate triplets as mentioned in the question.
- Use a left pointer initialised with 1 greater than the index and right pointer initialised to point to the last value.
- Update the left and right pointers according to sum equating to zero.
  - If the sum equals zero, both the left and right pointers must be updated.
  - It must also be ensured that the updated left and right pointers do not point to same values again. Note the check addded for this i.e. `while(l < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1])`. This is done to avoid duplicate triplets as mentioned in the question.

#### Complexity analysis

- Time Complexity : This is a quadratic, $O(n^2)$ solution in terms of time, where $n$ is size of the input array.
  - The sorting is $n*log(n)$.
  - The nested loops is almost $O(n^2)$.
  - Overall, it is $O(n*log(n) + n^2)$, where the quadratic term bounds the time complexity.
- Space Complexity : This is a constant, $O(1)$ solution in terms of space. Not considering the variable used to store the result.

## Follow ups

- Implement the algorithm to include a target to which the triplets must sum upto.

<!-- TODO - above one -->

## Notes

- Solve [two sum](./0001-two-sum.md) and [two sum II](./0167-two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted.md) before solving this one.

Python:

- Know the difference between `sort` which does inplace and `sorted` which returns a new array.

C++:

- Know how to use `std::sort`
